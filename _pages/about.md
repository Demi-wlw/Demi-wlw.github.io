I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Statistics from Hong Kong Baptist University and a Master’s degree in Statistics with Data Science from the University of Edinburgh. After completing my studies, I worked as a research assistant in the <a href='https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/data-science-unit'>Data Science Unit</a> (DSU) for Science, Health, People and Environment (SHaPE) within the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh.

With a strong foundation in mathematics, I enjoy exploring and understanding complex ideas through a logical and structured lens. This mindset not only shapes the way I approach research but also makes programming and analytical problem-solving more intuitive. My interests span statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, across structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. I'm passionate about both theoretical development and its real-world impact, and I strive to bridge the gap between innovative methodologies and practical applications. \
