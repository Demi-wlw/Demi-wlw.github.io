More about Eddie please see [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/research-computing/ecdf/high-performance-computing). Its command is based on the [Grid Scheduler](https://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/manuals.html).

## **Login**

Open the terminal and input:

```shell
ssh <YOUR UUN>@eddie.ecdf.ed.ac.uk
```

to login to the home directory.

> ##### WARNING
>
> As mentioned by the IT staff, Eddie of UoE does not support the `Remote-ssh` login in VScode extension due to security issues. 
> But it is fine to use the `scp` or `sftp` extension to only manage the file system.
{: .block-warning }

## **Folder Path**

This is the shared group space in UoE. \
**Eddie**:

```
/exports/<COLLEGE>/eddie/<SCHOOL>/groups/<GROUP NAME>/
```

**DataStore**:

```
/exports/<COLLEGE>/datastore/<SCHOOL>/groups/<GROUP NAME>/
```

> ##### TIP
>
> All-caps words in `< >` should be replaced with your own choices.
> DataStore is a network file storage service.

## **Basic Commands on Eddie**

To start an interactive session run:

```shell
qlogin
# The default maximum runtime is 48 hours. The default resources: 1 core, 1 GB memory.

qlogin -l h_vmem=1G
# request memory for an interactive session

qlogin -pe gpu 1
# request 1 gpu (need for torch and memory usage is at least 2GB)

qlogin -q staging
# choose the staging environment
```

Staging data (transfer data between Eddie and DataStore):

```shell
qsub stagein/out.sh
# stagein/out.sh file content can be seen in Eddie handbook (need UUN login)
```

> ##### TIP
>
> It is also possible to sync the files between local computer and Eddie directly using `scp` or `sftp`.
{: .block-tip }

To view current running jobs

```shell
qstat
```

To cancel a job,

```shell
qdel <JOB IDENTIFIER>
```

Detailed information about completed jobs is available with the qacct command:

```shell
qacct -j <JOB IDENTIFIER>
```

## **Set up the Anaconda Environment**

### Add path and create a virtual environment

Configure the path for your environments directory, i.e., the directory where all your conda environments will be stored, and packages (pkgs) directory used as a cache for your conda packages. By default cache for packages will be placed under `~/.conda/pkgs` and will very likely cause your home directory to go over quota as a result. We recommend using the group space you have used for your conda environments instead. **Note that this should be an existing directory, so you need to create it first if it doesn't already exist, before running the command below.**
{: .text-justify}

```shell
module load anaconda # version 5.0.1
```

Skip this step if already created the virtual environment

```shell
conda config --add envs_dirs /exports/<COLLEGE>/eddie/<SCHOOL>/groups/<GROUP NAME>/anaconda/envs

conda config --add pkgs_dirs /exports/<COLLEGE>/eddie/<SCHOOL>/groups/<GROUP NAME>/anaconda/pkgs
```

Once you have configured your `envs_dirs` and `pkgs_dirs`, you can create an environment. The example below creates an environment specifying particular Python versions (also the version used for this project):

```shell
conda create -n %env_name% python=3.9
```

To list your conda environments:

```shell
conda info --envs
```

### Activate your environment

Switch to the created environment and deactivate the environment when no longer needed:

```shell
source activate %env_name%
source deactivate
```

### Install required packages

```shell
conda install pip
pip --no-cache-dir install -r requirements.txt
# `--no-cache-dir` is to ensure torch installed successfully
```

**Some package management commands:**

```shell
conda list
# To see what packages are in the active environment
conda search matplotlib
# To search for a package in the Anaconda repositories
conda install matplotlib=1.4.1
# To install a package e.g. matplotlib version 1.4.1
```

#### Using pip

If a package is not available in the Anaconda repositories it can still be installed with `pip` in the usual way. First, install `pip` into your active Anaconda environment. You must install pip into your environment first before running a pip command. Otherwise, `pip install` will use the pip installed in the Anaconda directory (which users do not have write access to) and your installation will fail. Once you have installed pip in your environment, then you can install a package using pip into your environment:
{: .text-justify}

```shell
conda install pip
pip install matplotlib
```

## **Set up R Environment**

### Configure R packages path

```shell
module load cmake/3.5.2
# some packages may need this to be loaded first
module load igmm/apps/R/4.1.3
export R_LIBS=/exports/<COLLEGE>/eddie/<SCHOOL>/groups/<GROUP NAME>/rlibs
```

**Install required packages in R console**

```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## **Run Code on Eddie**

### Through job submission

**Example**

```shell
qsub run_job.sh
# job submission files are available in shell folder
```

### Through interaction session

First start an interaction session, specify max run time, memory usage (gpu) and activate the environment then run according to the following:

**Run Jupyter notebook**

```shell
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --inplace --execute jupyter-notebook.ipynb
```

Note that `nbconvert` will fail if any cell takes longer than 30s to run, then add the following option to disable timing

```
--ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=-1
```

View jupyter notebook ouptputs

```shell
nbpreview jupyter-notebook.ipynb
```
